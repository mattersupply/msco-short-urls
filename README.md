  MSCo ✂️: Short Soon, URL shortener with an airtable backend
</h1>

This is a simple short-url service that works with
[netlify functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/) and uses
[airtable](https://airtable.com).

## 🚀 Live demo

[msco.io](https://msco.io/)

Now go ahead and test that your redirects are working as expected. Just go to
the short URL version of your netlify app and it should redirect you like so:
https://msco.io/repos -> https://github.com/mattersupply/

If that works you're on the right track!
